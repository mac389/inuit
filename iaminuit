The umialik also recruit their whaling crew and act as benefactors to them and their families). They were relied upon so heavily because our economy back then was much different than today. People back then truly depended on our subsistence, and food was our survival and people looked to the captains for help. A lot of the rules are still instilled today, no different from 6,000 years ago.

I do a lot of trapping, sheep hunting, caribou hunting, and got into beaver trapping last year. I get odd jobs here and there. Last summer I was hiking up in the mountains, collecting caribou sheds and bundling those up and sending them to a guy in Fairbanks [Alaska]. That was pretty much my income for the summer. It wasn\u2019t much, but it got the bills paid. We sheep hunt; sometimes we get them right in the mountains here, and sometimes we have to travel 15-20 miles to the east or 15-20 miles to the west. I like to go further out. The majority of the sheep hunters in the village like to stay close to the village. I like to get out further and hopefully see bigger rams. \nI am part of a Trapper Man Forum online that's worldwide. About six months ago, a guy from the forum contacted me. He said they were coming up here in the late spring and needed a local guide to check out the proposed ice road to connect the Anaktuvuk village to the Dalton Highway. The road is supposed to help us with the shipping cost of our fuel and goods. Over the years, the village has met with ASRC (Arctic Slope Regional Corporation) and other entities to try and figure out how to lower the cost of shipping. This was one way to do that. Basically, they paid me to go out there with them and tell them where the open water is and where the creeks stay open during the winter. It was a 90-mile trip one way. It\u2019s about a 60-mile trip as the crow flies to the Haul Road, but the route we we\u2019re taking goes north to stay away from the bigger hills. It was a pretty cool trip. I brought back a caribou and three wolves. We were just going down the trail and they stopped and were looking at the GPS and I said, \u2018Be quiet a second!\u2019 I said, \u2018Just listen!\u2019 and we heard the faint howling of wolves.

So what we do get, has come a really long way. It\u2019s usually picked because it will last on a shelf for a long time.

I set up about five or six families with them and they grew kale and fresh romaine lettuce. Then this year, I found funding to buy a high tunnel.

We first got water and sewer in 2011, but on March, 24th 2016, the brand new water and sewer treatment center celebrated it\u2019s grand opening.\u201d Twenty-two Inupiaq and Yup\u2019ik communities in rural Alaska currently do not have water and sewer systems yet. This means that for sewage disposal, many operate on the \u201choney-bucket\u201d system which is typically a portable toilet or a 5 gallon bucket lined with a plastic bag liner and seat attached. The household sewage collected in the honey- buckets are either disposed of by individuals who haul it to the community sewage lagoon themselves or by paying for a city serviced "honey bucket bin", where the sewage is spilled and stored until picked up by city sewage workers who haul it to the sewage lagoon. Because these homes also do not have a piped water system, water is hauled in. While most communities have a local watering point where you can pay for treated water, many collect rain or get water from the river, and ice in the winter for drinking. Many of those communities also have a \u201cwasheteria\u201d which usually is a coin operated laundromat with showers.', u'id': u'1473180359639349_1584281661862551'}

We noticed it start changing in the late 90s. There used to be a lot of ice, where you could park and look out, have lunch, not anymore. The good old days are gone.

Valentines Day.\u201d\n\n MDC. \u201cMy name is Mary D. Charles, and Irving is my son. 31 years ago, Jim Richards started the basketball tournament. It was originally the White Mountain Valentines Tournament. I started back in 1988, I took over it, and have been running it. My son Irving started getting more involved about four years ago. I am slowly stepping out. My husband passed away in November of 1996, and from there, without my knowledge they changed the name of the tournament to the Robert Putto Charles Memorial Valentines Tournament in 1997.\u201d\n\n MDC. \u201cI have a lady\u2019s team staying at my house, I was telling them, back before people flew in, you could see 20 to 25 snow machine lights coming into town, that was fun.\u201d\n\n IA. \u201cOur tournament can hold 16 teams, we maxed out this year. Which is pretty good; in the past few years we haven\u2019t had a full 8-woman bracket, and having that really evens out the schedule. Because if we have more men\u2019s teams or women teams, the players might have to play back to back games. Having the 8 men\u2019s teams and 8 women teams really helps out schedule wise, and that way the players don\u2019t have to stretch themselves thin come Sunday. We are here from the first game in the morning, 8:30 AM - 9 AM until midnight three days in a row. We want to make something for people to come and enjoy and watch, half the time they aren\u2019t watching the ball game, they are sitting talking to their friends and relatives, laughing, talking about old stories and seeing old friends. Just sitting there and talking, that\u2019s the other part I like to look around and see, not just the basketball. Everybody connecting.\u201d\n\n \u2014Irving Ashenfelter and Mary D.

I am finishing up my master\u2019s degree in rural development, and a good portion of that is getting information from the village, to see if there would be any support in reestablishing the Qargi. I think there would be a lot of social issues that could be resolved with reintroducing the Qargi. It was an old method used in the old days that prevented a lot of social ills that we see today. It could also reinvigorate cultural or traditional identity within the young people. There isn\u2019t a whole lot of interaction between the elders and youth today, and I find that concerning. I never really had that trouble growing up, because my dad worked at Red Dog and I interacted with the elders out on the ice, and I knew that if I found the elders, I would find the fish. So I developed a relationship with the elders. I am going to school at UAF, I got my undergraduate degree in 2011 in geography. I think that opened the doors for me to understand the world outside of Alaskan society and made me wonder about different things I never really thought about. Coming into the rural development program, I was able to come back with some of the same concepts, but was closer to home. Early on the Qargi was removed and the church replaced it, but those mechanisms are still relevant today. After school, I would really like to work with the village in some sort of indigenous leadership compactly. One of the big reasons I went into the master program was because I was asked to be the village administer. I had just graduated with my degree in geography but I didn\u2019t feel ready; I knew there was a lot of things I had to learn.

It was 50 feet 9 inches. The tail was 16 feet long! But it was really good muktuk (whale skin and blubber). Our whaling crew is called Silver Star, it was [my husband\u2019s] dad\u2019s whaling crew name so we just used it. \n\nMy favorite part about living in Kaktovik is the peace and quiet, all the people here. We all know each other. We share our food. The best part is the food we eat is off the land and the ocean, and we share it with each other and we are not stingy. That\u2019s what I like about living here. \n\nMy part [as a whaling captain\u2019s wife] of the whaling crew, it\u2019s a lot of work, it\u2019s a lot of organizing and making sure everything gets done the way it\u2019s supposed to get done. I am happy to have my friend Fannie and the other crew members\u2019 girlfriends. When we catch the whale, it\u2019s really hard work, because you have to feed the village at lunch and at dinner in one day! That\u2019s hard work, especially when you only have three cutters. I am lucky\u2014I had my cousin come over and cook everything while we cut. And all the men, they make sure the meat is cut and get it ready for us to cut it into smaller pieces. It\u2019s hard work, especially for a first time catching a whale. I have been through it; I was on my dad\u2019s crew growing up. I knew how things were and we had a lot of elders teaching us. We would go help them and they would teach us how to do things like clean the intestines, cut the heart, cut the kidney and how skinny to cut the mukluk for boiling and how small to cut the meat and tongue. Then everybody is welcome into your small tiny home to come eat!\u201d\u2014 Alicia Solomon is Inupiaq from Kaktovik, Alaska.', u'id': u'1473180359639349_1546323852324999'}

Our ancestors have been passing these songs on since time memorial. \n\nI myself have composed over 20 songs. That dance that we do that they call the \u2018Walrus Dance,\u2019 has got pretty popular. The second time we performed it, I told the crowd that this song is actually called \u2018My Brothers Keeper,\u2019 and is a song that I would like everybody to understand. It\u2019s more than a walrus dance, it\u2019s more than goose bumps; it\u2019s a song about domestic violence. It\u2019s about one brother who is trapped in the cycle of domestic violence, and his other brother is one that has been in that cycle but has been freed from it, because he got in tune with his culture and with who he is as an individual. And throughout the confines of the song, he is trying to help his brother out of the cycle. In the middle of the song, when they stand up, that\u2019s when he is helping him to rise, and his brother can finally rise and dance again and know who he is as an individual. And then they start to dance together. \n\nI myself have been personally affected and entangled in that trap, so in its own unique way, it\u2019s a song about my story of getting out of that trap of domestic violence and understanding how ugly it is. Especially in rural Alaska. We tend to not want to talk about it and want to say \u2018It\u2019s that individual\u2019s or that family's problem,\u2019 but I think its good to talk about it.\n\nI published a book\u2014it\u2019s on Amazon\u2014and I would like to travel to villages to talk to young people about these issues.

Ours was 44.6 feet long.\n\nI am the captain\u2019s wife, second in authority\u2014actually, first from what I was told. When I found out, I said, you all know what to do, do your thing. My first crew I went on was my dad\u2019s crew. I was 16. Then I married Eddie. I used to go out with his uncle\u2019s crew, then he passed the crew down to Eddie, and that\u2019s when we found out how it really works... Eddie\u2019s uncle showed us how the authority works, how to do this and that. How to talk to new crew members, what not to do out there and what to expect from them. Sometimes you don\u2019t know about first timers\u2014one of our first timers went out and he hollered out there, and that\u2019s not a good thing. We went right over the whale and he was like \u201cAAH!\u201d You\u2019re not supposed to holler when you\u2019re hunting! You keep quiet; you keep your eyes out for the blows. All eyes are always looking out because there is a whale out there somewhere. You will find it, and sometimes there is a bunch of them, all at once, one strike\u2014we go for that one strike. We never caught two whales at a time before. I never want to see that happen because it will drain out everybody, trying to cut them up and get them put away before the polar bears get to them. There is 24-hour Nanuk patrol during whaling, because we've got polar bears waiting. You can see one of our pictures over there, one of our guys is bringing blubber to a polar bear that didn\u2019t want to go away, so they brought him some blubber to keep him away from the cutting. \u2014 Marie Rexford is Inupiaq from Kaktovik, Alaska.", u'id': u'1473180359639349_1538558719768179'}

"Human stories \u2014 the stories of real people \u2014 are the most meaningful way we can begin to understand one another."\n\nBeginning this summer, award-winning Inupiaq photographer Brian Adams has been traveling to Arctic communities on behalf of ICC-Alaska to meet and photograph the Inuit people of the Arctic. Adams\' environmental portraiture has been showcased in galleries throughout the United States and in his 2013 book of photography, I Am Alaskan.\n\nIn each community he visits, Adams is collecting the portraits and stories of the indigenous people ofAlaska\'s Arctic. The photos and stories will be shared on I Am Inuit\'s social media pages (Facebook,Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr) and on a website dedicated to the project, www.iaminuit.org. Publication of a book is also planned.\n\n"Most often, when people think of the Arctic and Alaska, they think of polar bears and natural resources," Stotts said. "They don\'t realize that Inuit have thrived in the Arctic for thousands of years. I Am Inuit celebrates our culture and society, and we hope it will help our fellow Americans better understand the Arctic."\nI Am Inuit has already visited Quinhagak, Teller, and Shungnak. Travel will continue through the winter, with visits planned to Point Hope, Wainwright, Anaktuvuk Pass, Kaktovik, Buckland, Noorvik, Noatak,Shishmaref, Shaktoolik, White Mountain, Hooper Bay, Alakanuk, and Tuluksak. It is hoped that eventually the project may be expanded to other Arctic countries.\n\n***ICC-Alaska is a 501(c) 3 non-profit organization that works on behalf of the Inupiat of the North Slope,Northwest and Bering Straits; the St. Lawrence Island Yupik; the Central Yup\u2019ik and Cup\u2019ik of the Yukon-Kuskokwim Region in Southwest Alaska.
