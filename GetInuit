I keep thinking of my dad and how, through his doing, Bowie\'s music really sculptured the soundtrack to my childhood.\n\nRIP David Bowie. Our thoughts go to his loved ones & the droves of people that feel that they have lost something today.\n\nBut a quote, which I found from various sources, has helped raise a smile:\n\n"If you feel sad, remember the world is 4.54 billion years old & you managed to exist at the same time as David Bowie."\n\n\U0001f643\U0001f643\U0001f643\U0001f643\n\nTomorrow night, we are playing a Huw Stephens\' club night at The Social, London.
