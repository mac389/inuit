We realize this can sometimes be confusing and frustrating, especially with different messaging coming from other sources, such as a hamlet or city office.\n\nIf a hamlet or city office declares its roads closed, the Deputy Minister of Finance will immediately issue a community-wide closure. This decision will remain in effect until the hamlet or city office declares the roads open again. The hamlet or city office advising residents to stay off the roads is not a closure \u2013 it is a recommendation to help the hamlet or city office in their efforts. The work of the GN is critical to ensure program and service delivery for all Nunavummiut. Closing offices is not a decision that can be taken lightly.\n\nIf at any time, a GN employee fears for their safety driving on the roads, they can use leave to stay home. Please use personal discretion. If you do not feel safe travelling to work, stay home and advise your employer that you will take leave instead.\n\nFor more information, please read the GN\u2019s bad weather directive at: http://goo.gl/L8p8fe \n\nWeather closures are always posted at:\n\xb7        Twitter:  https://goo.gl/BDWhWX\n\n\xb7        Facebook: http://goo.gl/q8ZZEG', u'id': u'244924798918807_1008912869186659'}

How will you participate this week?\n\nDo you know that your leftover barbecue starter fluid, paints, antifreeze and toilet bowl cleaners are household hazardous wastes? Don\u2019t throw these things in the garbage because they\u2019re bad for the environment. These should be brought to the landfill separately so they can be properly contained by landfill staff to prevent spillage.\n\nHousehold hazardous wastes can be identified by their international hazard symbols. Take time to understand these symbols.\n \n1. Poisonous: If you swallow, lick, or in some cases, breathe in the chemical, you could become very sick or die.\n\n2. Flammable: The product or its fumes will catch fire easily if it is near heat, flames, or sparks. Rags used with this product may begin to burn on their own.\n\n3. Corrosive: The product can burn your skin or eyes. If swallowed, it can damage your throat and stomach.\n\n4. Explosive: The container can explode if heated or punctured. Flying pieces of metal or plastic from the container can cause serious injury, especially to your eyes.\n\nIf your household hazardous items are poisonous, flammable, corrosive or explosive, do not pour them down the drain or put them in the garbage!
