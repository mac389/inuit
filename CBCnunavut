Snow and strong southeast winds continue to develop ahead of this system resulting in blizzard conditions for south Baffin Island. Snowfall amounts of 5 to 10 cm with local amounts up to 15 cm are possible from this system, especially over higher terrain and along the coast near Kimmirut. The snow along with southeast winds gusting up to 90 km/h will cause visibilities to be near zero at times today. Conditions will begin to improve late this afternoon for Kimmirut and Iqaluit as winds diminish and snowfall eases.\n\nStrong northwest winds as high as 50 gusting 70 km/h from Baker Lake to Arviat with visibilities near zero. Temperatures have also dropped into the minus thirties producing wind chill values below minus 55. Blizzard conditions will begin in Coral Harbour and Naujaat this morning as the strong winds shift to the northwest. Widespread visibilities near zero are expected to continue into late Sunday for much of the Kivalliq as strong northwest winds persist.\n\nThere are also blizzard/wind warnings in effect for Salluit, Ivujivik, Kangiqsujuaq, Kangiqsualujjuaq, and Quaqtaq in Nunavik', u'id': u'542767749191161_769975463137054'}

"When you wake up and you feel this is the day, please speak to somebody, whether it\'s a friend, a family member, the quit line, or somebody at your community health centre or public health." \n\nThe Baffin region\'s Laura-Jeannie Gibbons and Sean MacIntosh, Kivalliq\'s Catherine Aggark, and the Kitikmeot\'s Marc Auger each won a grand prize of a $5,000 travel package. \n\nTheir "quit buddies" were Mavis Panipakuchoo, Shawn\nBalfour, Debra Taipana, and Robyn Clarke.\n\nThis year, health officials used a breathalyzer test to make sure the grand prize winners hadn\'t smoked and all four passed the test.\n\nBest says some participants did admit to smoking during the contest and voluntarily withdrew.', u'id': u'542767749191161_664479297020005'}

An avalanche of powder snow, ultra fast. We were having breakfast in the tent when the snow has buried us, our sledge was lying partly on top of us. Fortunately people have witnessed the accident, some had to run to escape the snow slide. It was a great fear for everybody. Eric managed to extricate himself from the ripped tent, I thought I suffocate under the weight of snow with Leonie on top of me in panic... Anyway, we just escaped. Then we lived a great moment of solidarity. Twenty friends worked, some helping to found our material, other reassuring and warming our traumatized girls, welcoming us all into their warm shelter, which one was quickly removed from the danger zone. Only our shovel and our boots were lost, our tent was destroyed, and we ended up with few injuries. Leonie has a bruise and a scar that heals slowly on the back of the head (which has worried us), Aurore has nothing, Eric wears a neck brace to relieve pain after a blow (hard to know exactly what happened...) and I heal a small cut to the ear, but something hit me hard on the same side, my jaw which had moved have recovered, there is probably only a small fracture in the cheekbone. Eric and I relief pain with analgesics. The shock passed, we understand that it could have been much worse..\n\nYou can follow the family from France living in Nunavut on their blog link:  \nhttp://vagabond.fr/index.en', u'story': u'CBC Nunavut added 2 new photos.', u'id': u'542767749191161_660162430785025'}

The structure is part of Kangiakallak-1 site (JeGn-2) located on Qikirtajuaq (also known as Cape Smith) near the community of Akulivik.\nIt\u2019s location on the paved floor does not automatically make it a carpet. Would people have made it a carpet at that time? In fact, it may also be a fragment of clothing, or some other element such as a blanket. The state of preservation, as exceptional as it is, is however not sufficient to permit a clear interpretation. Perhaps it was not considered useful anymore for their journey toward the warmer season?\nThe fur has been treated for long term preservation thanks to the CCI (Canadian Conservation Institute). We received it a few weeks ago and thought it deserved to be shared with you. The long hair and the coloration seem to suggest that it is a caribou fur. Two radiocarbon dates (one from a wood sample and the other one on caribou bone) and the early style of the objects found indicate an occupation during the 13th century.\nPicture by Robert Fr\xe9chette', u'id': u'542767749191161_641178116016790'}

Igloolik Cooperative Started its We Care Package Program as report by all your news outlets a little over a month ago, following suit most cooperatives came on board, recognizing a need Local residents in Igloolik started a brand new food bank as none existed. By Contacts Made on the Helping my Northern Neighbors group with Andrea Seiad (Chapter Head of Winsor Ontario HONN group) the Igloolik Coop was able to facilitate purchases by them of a large volume as well as donations from the Coop to keep the food bank running for several weeks.\nIt Soon Became apparent that it was not enough food and baby supplies to accommodate the need in such a large community. In a daily conversation in Our Local Co-op coffee shop the Idea to join forces to support our local food bank was had. Jointly the Igloolik CO-OP and the Local Igloolik RCMP launched its first Annual Jail & Bail Food Bank Fundraiser. This event occurred on March 7th, and was a great success! The community Really came together. CO-OP Members provided Baked Goods for our Coffee Break Fundraiser, The boys in Blue built a make shift Jail right in our CO-OP store, The Community Came in droves to participate.\n \nIt was so much fun the children and some adult were donating  to the cause just to have themselves Jailed. As the RCMP travelled around the Community Arresting Community Members who were nominated by friends and love ones, everyone piled in the CO-OP to take pictures, Bail them Out and participate in any number of other fundraising events we held that day.  The students Jailed there teachers, the teachers in turn Jailed the principal! It was truly a gathering of the community in every sense of the word. Warm coffee was served free to all and a baked treat for those donating. Igloolik really stepped up!\n \nNear the end of the event it a truly touching manner several High school students approached Management with a $750 donation from their own exchange trip fundraising. This donation alone proves the selfless nature of our community members, the strong characteristics our members have, and the sharing nature passed on still today to it younger generations.\n \nThe End Result of 4 fun filled hours was $3300 dollars worth of non perishable food that is hitting the bare shelf\u2019s of Igloolik Food Bank this week! Woo Hoo!  we know for a few more weeks that some bellies in Igloolik will be full that otherwise had no means to eat.\nIt is Our Hope at Igloolik CO-OP that in the same tradition of our other Community initiatives that this to may serve as inspiration for Communities across the north to do similar. We would like to thanks Members of the RCMP, The volunteers from the community and food bank, as well as the CO-OP staff who worked hard keeping everything on cue, and last but not least all the people who donated to surpass our original $2000 dollar goal.\n \nWe hope you find this story as heartwarming as we have.\n\nSincerely,\nDana Sheaves\nIgloolik Cooperative.', u'story': u'CBC Nunavut added 3 new photos.', u'id': u'542767749191161_621479114653357'}

The walk was originally started by Dr Stanley Vollant in 2010 an Innu doctor.. He started from Natashquan, then on to Baie Johaan Betz and to other First Nations communities. The 6000 km walk has spanned over five years and more people have joined in the walk including youth. Dr. Vollant\'s objective is to talk to as many young people he can about the importance to "have dreams, to work on their realizations, of their culture and identity". The distance between Matimukush to Kuujjuaq is approximately 550 kilometers. It is expected the walk on snowshoes may take one month to reach Kuujjuaq. \nDr Vollant is the first native surgeon in Quebec and works at the Pessamit Medical Clinic.', u'id': u'542767749191161_614662875334981'}
